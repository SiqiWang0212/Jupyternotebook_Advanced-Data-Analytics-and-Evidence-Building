    "- **Overfitting**: This happens when a model is too complex or too sensitive to the noise in the data; this can\n",
    "result in poor generalization performance, or applicability of the model to new data. \n",

    "For example, you can limit the number of features present in the final model, or the weight coefficients applied\n",

    "## The Machine Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Machine Learning Process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the problem and goal.** *This sounds obvious but is often nontrivial.* Problems typically start as vague descriptions of a goal - improving health outcomes, increasing graduation rates, understanding the effect of a variable *X* on an outcome *Y*, etc. It is really important to work with people who understand the domain being studied to dig deeper and define the problem more concretely. What is the analytical formulation of the metric that you are trying to optimize?\n",
    "- **Formulate it as a machine learning problem.** Is it a classification problem or a regression problem? Is the goal to build a model that generates a ranked list prioritized by risk, or is it to detect anomalies as new data come in? Knowing what kinds of tasks machine learning can solve will allow you to map the problem you are working on to one or more machine learning settings and give you access to a suite of methods.\n",
    "- **Data exploration and preparation.** Next, you need to carefully explore the data you have. What additional data do you need or have access to? What variable will you use to match records for integrating different data sources?  What variables exist in the data set? Are they continuous or categorical? What about missing values? Can you use the variables in their original form, or do you need to alter them in some way?\n",
    "- **Feature engineering.** In machine learning language, what you might know as independent variables or predictors or factors or covariates are called \"features.\" Creating good features is probably the most important step in the machine learning process. This involves doing transformations, creating interaction terms, or aggregating over data points or over time and space.\n",
    "- **Method selection.** Having formulated the problem and created your features, you now have a suite of methods to choose from. It would be great if there were a single method that always worked best for a specific type of problem. Typically, in machine learning, you take a variety of methods and try them, empirically validating which one is the best approach to your problem.\n",
    "- **Evaluation.** As you build a large number of possible models, you need a way choose the best among them. We'll cover methodology to validate models on historical data and discuss a variety of evaluation metrics. \n",
    "- **Deployment.** Once you have selected the best model and validated it using historical data as well as a field trial, you are ready to put the model into practice. You still have to keep in mind that new data will be coming in, and the model might change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably used to fitting models in social science classes. In those cases, you probably had a hypothesis or theory about the underlying process that gave rise to your data, chose an appropriate model based on prior knowledge and fit it using least squares, and used the resulting parameter or coefficient estimates (or confidence intervals) for inference. This type of modeling is very useful for *interpretation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, our primary concern is *generalization*. This means that:\n",
    "- **We care less about the structure of the model and more about the performance** This means that we'll try out a whole bunch of models at a time and choose the one that works best, rather than determining which model to use ahead of time. We can then choose to select a *suboptimal* model if we care about a specific model type. \n",
    "- **We don't (necessarily) want the model that best fits the data we've *already seen*,** but rather the model that will perform the best on *new data*. This means that we won't gauge our model's performance using the same data that we used to fit the model (e.g., sum of squared errors or $R^2$), and that \"best fit\" or accuracy will most often *not* determine the best model.  \n",
    "- **We can include a lot of variables in to the model.** This may sound like the complete opposite of what you've heard in the past, and it can be hard to swallow. "

    "## Data Exploration and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first classes, we have explored the data, linked different data sources, and created new variables. The first steps of creating a machine learning model are exactly that. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating the label**: The Lable is the dependent variable, or *Y* variable, that we are trying to predict. In the machine learning framework, labels are often *binary*: true or false, encoded as 1 or 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decide on features**: Our features are our independent variables or predictors. Good features make machine learning systems effective. The better the features the easier it is the capture the structure of the data. You generate features using domain knowledge. In general, it is better to have more complex features and a simpler model rather than vice versa. Keeping the model simple makes it faster to train and easier to understand rather then extensively searching for the \"right\" model and \"right\" set of parameters. Machine Learning Algorithms learn a solution to a problem from sample data. The set of features is the best representation of the sample data to learn a solution to a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem/data/structure  to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.\" ( from [Discover Feature Engineering](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/) ). Example of feature engineering are: \n",
    "    - **Transformations**, such a log, square, and square root.\n",
    "    - **Dummy (binary) variables**, sometimes known as *indicator variables*, often done by taking categorical variables (such as industry) which do not have a numeric value, and adding them to models as a binary value.\n",
    "    - **Aggregation.** Aggregate features often constitute the majority of features for a given problem. These use different aggregation functions (*count, min, max, average, standard deviation, etc.*) which summarize several values into one feature, aggregating over varying windows of time and space. For example, we may want to calculate the *number* (and *min, max, mean, variance*, etc.) of crimes within an *m*-mile radius of an address in the past *t* months for varying values of *m* and *t*, and then use all of them as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cleaning data**: To run the `scikit-learn` set of models your input dataset must have no missing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imputing values to missing or irrelevant data**: Once the features are created, always check to make sure the values make sense. You might have some missing values, or impossible values for a given variable (negative values, major outliers). If you have missing values you should think hard about what makes the most sense for your problem; you may want to replace with `0`, the median or mean of your data, or some other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization**: Certain models will have an issue with features on different scales. For example, an individual's age is typically a number between 0 and 100 while earnings can be number between 0 and 1000000 (or higher). In order to circumvent this problem, we can scale our features to the same range (eg [0,1])."

Rather, models produce a score between 0 and 1 (that can sometimes be interpreted as a probability), which lets you more finely rank all of the examples from *most likely* to *least likely* to have label 1 (positive). This score is then turned into a 0 or 1 based on a user-specified threshold. For example, you might label all examples that have a score greater than 0.5 (1/2) as positive (1), but there's no reason that has to be the cutoff. "

    "Once we have tuned our scores to 0 or 1 for classification, we create a *confusion matrix*, which  has four cells: true negatives, true positives, false negatives, and false positives. Each data point belongs in one of these cells, because it has both a ground truth and a predicted label. If an example was predicted to be negative and is negative, it's a true negative. If an example was predicted to be positive and is positive, it's a true positive. If an example was predicted to be negative and is positive, it's a false negative. If an example was predicted to be positive and is negative, it's a false negative.\n",

For instance, say NIH wants to host a workshop for people they think are likley to do brain cancer research in the future, The workshop is expensive so they only want to select the top 1% of people who are likley to do brain cancer researh in the future. In that case, we would want to prioritize the 1% of applicants who are *most likely* to have future brain cancer research, and it doesn't matter too much how accurate we are on the ones who aren't very likely to have brain cancer researh in the future. We can then focus on optimizing our **precision at 1%**."

Rather, models produce a score between 0 and 1 (that can sometimes be interpreted as a probability), which lets you more finely rank all of the examples from *most likely* to *least likely* to have label 1 (positive). This score is then turned into a 0 or 1 based on a user-specified threshold. For example, you might label all examples that have a score greater than 0.5 (1/2) as positive (1), but there's no reason that has to be the cutoff. "

Each data point belongs in one of these cells, because it has both a ground truth and a predicted label. If an example was predicted to be negative and is negative, it's a true negative. If an example was predicted to be positive and is positive, it's a true positive. If an example was predicted to be negative and is positive, it's a false negative. If an example was predicted to be positive and is negative, it's a false negative.\n",

For instance, say NIH wants to host a workshop for people they think are likley to do brain cancer research in the future, The workshop is expensive so they only want to select the top 1% of people who are likley to do HPV researh in the future. In that case, we would want to prioritize the 1% of applicants who are *most likely* to have future HPV cancer research, and it doesn't matter too much how accurate we are on the ones who aren't very likely to have HPV cancer researh in the future. We can then focus on optimizing our **precision at 1%**."
